## Hi there, I'm Alper! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate & entrepreneurial JavaScript developer and educator who likes to push the web beyond it's limits. I specialize in modern frontend using React & Angular and I also feel at home on the backend using Node. I'm interested in helping create innovative web apps that users love.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/alperg/) and
